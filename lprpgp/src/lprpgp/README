LPRPG - Beta Release 1
----------------------

This directory contains the source release of LPRPG - LPRPG, as in the 2008 ICAPS paper plus a few bug fixes.

For convenience, a copy of lpsolve compiled for x86 is provided along with the necesary headers.  The sources can be obtained from: 

http://sourceforge.net/projects/lpsolve

Compiling
---------

To compile, type make.  It is known to build with g++ v4.2.4 on Ubuntu, any compile-time gremlins can likely be ascribed to PDDL parsing.

To run the planner, type:

./lprpg domain.pddl problem.pddl

For details of the extra flags, run ./lprpg with no options.
