About
-----

This directory contains the planner LPRPGP, as described in the ICAPS 2011
paper 'LPRPG-P: Relaxed Plan Heuristics for Planning with Preferences' by
Amanda Coles and Andrew Coles.  In domains without preferences, it functions
as LPRPG, described in the paper 'A Hybrid Relaxed Planning Graph-LP Heuristic
for Numeric Planning Domains', additionally authored by Maria Fox and Derek
Long.

Compiling
---------

LPRPG-P uses CPLEX for solving its LPs.  As CPLEX doesn't install into standard
locations, you need to edit the build script to find them.  The default
settings in the script are:

export CPLEX="$HOME/ilog/cplex121/lib/x86-64_debian4.0_4.1/static_pic/libcplex.a"
export ILOCPLEX="$HOME/ilog/cplex121/lib/x86-64_debian4.0_4.1/static_pic/libilocplex.a"
export CONCERT="$HOME/ilog/concert29/lib/x86-64_debian4.0_4.1/static_pic/libconcert.a"
export CPLEX_INCLUDES="$HOME/ilog/cplex121/include"
export CONCERT_INCLUDES="$HOME/ilog/concert29/include"

If you aren't running it on a 64-bit machine, x86-64_debian4.0_4.1 should probably
be changed to x86_debian4.0_4.1.

After that, ./build should work.

Running
-------

Again, because LPRPG-P uses CPLEX, it needs access to a CPLEX licence at run-time
in numeric domains.  If your shell is bash, that usually means adding a line:

export ILOG_LICENSE_FILE="$HOME/ilog/access.ilm"

... or similar to $HOME/.bashrc .  Once that has been done, run:

./plan <domain> <problem> <solution filename>

As LPRPG-P is an any-time planer, it will save sequentially numbered plans.
