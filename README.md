# Ethical PDDL

Extension of PDDL with ethical rules

- benchmarks: test scripts
- domains: IPC domains with ethical rules
- transpiler: compiler from ethical rules to PDDL utilities
- lprpg-p: utility PDDL planner

*Note*: it is necessary to compile the planner to execute the scripts. CPLEX library is needed for this.
