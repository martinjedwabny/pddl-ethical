Includes:

- Cost-optimal search for linear metrics with integer coefficients

---

Bidirectional BFS in propositional domains and simple preferences

Grounding input 

./ground <domain-file> <problem-file>

writes domain.pddl problem.pddl and problem.psas

Calling the solver 

./bdd-solver

writes mips-solution and simple-solution 

./bdd-solver -? 

provides some command line options of the solver

---

Generic call, also for qualitative preferences

./compile <domain.pddl> <problem.pddl>

Known issues:

- Growth of BDD-sizes to be adapted to exploit different amounts of 
main memory, default for 16 GB exploration

 INITIAL_NODES 32000000
 MAX_INCREASE  128000000

- implementation of temporal modalities "hold", "within", etc. commented 

- Growth of BDD-sizes beyond 2GB RAM only possible on 64-bit machines
